# DevOps with Github Actions

A sample organization to demonstrate the use of Github Actions to automate CICD governance and compliance. Any reasonably sized organization will require all teams and developers follow a common CICD pattern for building, testing, packaging, and deploying code in order to create consistency and governance. 

## What can you do?

* Starter workflow templates to standardize Github Action workflows tailored for languages, frameworks, and build tools used by projects.
* Extract out commonly used and relatively frequently changing steps into composit actions.
